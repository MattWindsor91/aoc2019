# Advent of Code 2019

This repository includes various attempts I've made at the Advent of Code 2019
problems.

**Note:** This year, I'm really struggling to find time and motivation to work
on AoC, so don't expect particularly fast or elegant solutions.

These solutions are in:

- Typed Racket (`.rkt`): day 1
- C# (`.cs`, in the `AoC2019` solution folder, one project per day): day 2

## Usage

The usage depends on the language:

- For Racket solutions (`.rkt`), load the file into a REPL like DrRacket and
  run it.  The file will describe, in comments, what the output means.
  Each day expects the input to be in a file `dayX.txt`, where `X` is
  the day in question.
- For C# solutions (`.cs`), compile and/or run from the `AoC2019.sln` Visual
  Studio solution.  Each day expects the input path to be given as the first
  argument.

## Licencing

All of this is available under the WTFPL.  In short, just do what the fuck you
want to with them.

## Why so many languages?

Because I'm really bad at choosing one and sticking with it.

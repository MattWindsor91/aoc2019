# Advent of Code 2019

This repository includes various attempts I've made at the Advent of Code 2019
problems.

**Note:** This year, I'm really struggling to find time and motivation to work
on AoC, so don't expect particularly fast or elegant solutions.

These solutions are in:

- Typed Racket (`.rkt`)

## Usage

Each solution will expect the input to be in a file `dayX.txt`, where `X` is
the day in question.

- For Racket solutions (`.rkt`), load the file into a REPL like DrRacket and
  run it.  The file will describe, in comments, what the output means.

## Licencing

All of this is available under the WTFPL.  In short, just do what the fuck you
want to with them.
